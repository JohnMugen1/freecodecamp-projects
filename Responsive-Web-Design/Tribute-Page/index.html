          <h2><strong>Steve Jobs All Time Quotes:</strong></h2>
          <p><i>"Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking."</i></p>
          <p><i>"That's been one of my mantras — focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."</i></p>
          <p><i>"I’m convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance."</i></p>
          <p><i>"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully."</i></p>
